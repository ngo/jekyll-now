title: How to make Burp Repeater better
---

I've been doing web penetration testing and webapp source code audits since 2010.
During black box testing the main tool of choice is, not suprisingly, Burp Suite Pro.
I always do the most crucials parts of analysis manually, so Burp Repeater is the tab where I spend most of my time.

Though being a great and indispensable tool, in a typical project my Repeater usually quickly starts to look like this:
![Many tabs in burp repeater][repeater_madness]

We deserve better, and instead of ocasional rants I've decided to draft a specification of how the repeater of my dreams
will look and feel.

The [specification](/better-repeater) is currently a (very early) work in progress. All comments and suggestions are very much appreciated though!
