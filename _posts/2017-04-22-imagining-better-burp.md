title: How to make Burp better
---

I've been doing web penetration testing and webapp source code audits since 2010.
During black box testing the main tool of choice is, not suprisingly, Burp Suite Pro.
I always do the most crucials parts of analysis manually, so Burp Repeater is the tab where I spend most of my time.

But for manual testing of a sufficiently large app, repeater quicly gets cluttered:
![Many tabs in burp repeater][repeater_madness]

We deserve better, and instead of ocasional rants I've decided to draft a proposal on how we can improve burp with the focus on performing manual (and perhaps automated) testing in a more efficient way. 

The [proposal](/better-burp) is currently a (very early) work in progress. All comments and suggestions are very much appreciated though!
